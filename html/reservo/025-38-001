If you are encoutering the same issue, you should :

Root your phone

Download a root file explorer

Open the file build.prop located in /system

Find the lane "persist.vendor.audio.fluence.voicecall=true" (might vary a little bit)

Replace it by "persist.vendor.audio.fluence.voicecall=false" (Without quotes ofc)

Save build.prop and double check that saves have been done

Reboot your phone

Be careful when playing with the build.prop because it may result in a bootloop!!

You should now be able to call people!
